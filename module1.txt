Notes:Module1
1. Data Generation and Augmentation:
Generative AI Tools for Data Engineering: The module introduces various generative AI models and tools used for generating and augmenting data. For instance, you might learn how to use tools like GPT-3 or GANs to create synthetic datasets that can be used to supplement real data. This is especially useful in situations where data is limited, biased, or sensitive.
Example: Suppose you're working with a small dataset of customer transactions. You could use a generative AI model to augment this dataset by generating additional synthetic transactions that reflect the same statistical properties as the original data, thus enriching the training data for machine learning models.
2. Data Anonymization:
Applying Generative AI for Anonymization: This part of the module focuses on how generative AI can be leveraged to anonymize datasets. The goal is to transform sensitive data into a form that cannot be traced back to individuals while retaining its utility for analysis.
Example: A hands-on lab might involve taking a dataset with personally identifiable information (PII) and using a generative model to produce a new dataset where sensitive attributes are replaced with realistic synthetic equivalents, ensuring privacy while allowing for data analysis.
3. Designing Data Pipelines and ETL Processes:
Generative AI in ETL Workflows: The module covers how generative AI can automate and enhance various aspects of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. This includes using AI to generate code for data extraction or to optimize transformation logic based on the data being processed.
Example: In a lab session, you might be tasked with creating a generative AI-powered ETL pipeline that automatically generates SQL queries to transform raw data into a structured format suitable for loading into a data warehouse.
4. Database Schema Design:
Using Generative AI for Schema Design: This section explores how generative AI can assist in designing database schemas by generating schema recommendations based on the dataâ€™s structure and usage patterns.
Example: You could use a generative AI model to analyze existing datasets and suggest an optimized schema for a new data warehouse, ensuring that the schema supports efficient queries and storage.
5. Hands-on Labs:
Throughout the module, there are hands-on labs where learners directly apply what they've learned. These labs are designed to simulate real-world scenarios, allowing you to practice implementing generative AI solutions in data engineering tasks.
Example: A lab might guide you through the process of setting up a data pipeline that uses generative AI to handle the transformation of incoming data streams, automatically generating the necessary code and configurations.
6. Ethical Considerations:
The module also includes discussions on the ethical use of generative AI in data engineering. This involves understanding the potential risks and ensuring that AI-generated data and processes adhere to ethical standards.
Example: You might analyze case studies where generative AI was used in ways that posed ethical challenges, learning how to mitigate such risks in your own projects.
