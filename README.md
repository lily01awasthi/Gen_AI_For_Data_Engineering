# Generative AI for Data Engineering
This repository contains notes and projects from the "Generative AI for Data Engineering" course that I am currently taking on Coursera. The course explores how generative AI can be applied in various aspects of data engineering, including data anonymization, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, synthetic data generation, and data analysis.

# Project Files
* data_anonymize_with_gen_ai.ipynb: A notebook demonstrating how generative AI techniques can be used for data anonymization.
* etl_using_gen_ai.ipynb: This notebook covers how to integrate generative AI into ETL processes.
* gen_ai_for_data_analysis.ipynb: Practical examples of using generative AI for data analysis.
* synthetic_data_generation.ipynb: A project focused on generating synthetic data using generative AI methods.
