# Generative AI for Data Engineering
This repository contains notes and projects from the "Generative AI for Data Engineering" course that I am currently taking on Coursera. The course explores how generative AI can be applied in various aspects of data engineering, including data anonymization, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, synthetic data generation, and data analysis.

# Project Files
* data_anonymize_with_gen_ai.ipynb: A notebook demonstrating how generative AI techniques can be used for data anonymization.
* etl_using_gen_ai.ipynb: This notebook covers how to integrate generative AI into ETL processes.
* gen_ai_for_data_analysis.ipynb: Practical examples of using generative AI for data analysis.
* synthetic_data_generation.ipynb: A project focused on generating synthetic data using generative AI methods.



**TODO: Generate synthetic data for thesis project using generative ai for policy making **
For the selection of covariates that can represent relevant features in the study, covariates that capture individual heterogeneity, treatment assignment mechanisms, and outcomes of interest can be as follows.

## Demographic Variables
* Age: Continuous or categorical variable that can influence both treatment assignment and outcome.
* Gender: Categorical variable, e.g., male, female, non-binary.
* Education Level: Ordinal variable (e.g., high school, college, graduate degree).
* Income: Continuous variable representing economic status. It may be predictive of both the outcome and the probability of receiving treatment.
* Ethnicity: Categorical variable, potentially relevant to treatment effects depending on the context.

## Socio-Economic Variables
* Employment Status: Categorical variable (e.g., employed, unemployed, part-time).
* Household Size: Continuous or categorical variable.
* Neighborhood Quality: Can be represented as a composite index or categorical variable (urban, rural, etc.).
* Access to Healthcare: Binary variable, indicating whether an individual has access to health services.

## Behavioral Variables
* Risk-Taking Propensity: Continuous variable, representing how likely someone is to engage in risky behavior.
* Health Behaviors: E.g., smoking, exercise frequency, etc.
* Political Affiliation: Categorical variable, influencing treatment participation or response to certain policy interventions.

## Contextual Variables
* Region/Geography: Categorical variable (e.g., state, city, or rural/urban division).
* Policy Exposure: Binary or continuous variable indicating exposure to certain policies in the past.
* Year/Period: Time-based variable that can account for temporal effects on treatment and outcomes.

## Treatment Variable
* Treatment Assignment: Binary variable representing whether an individual received the treatment (e.g., 1 for treated, 0 for control).
* Treatment Intensity: Continuous variable for cases where the treatment is not binary (e.g., the amount of financial aid received).

## Outcome Variables
* Economic Outcome: Continuous variable representing income, employment status after treatment, or another relevant economic metric.
* Health Outcome: Continuous variable representing health improvement or binary variable indicating health conditions (e.g., developed a disease or not).
* Educational Outcome: Measured as continuous (grades, years of schooling) or categorical variables (graduated or not).

##  Interaction Variables
* Interaction between Age and Treatment: Older individuals might respond differently to the treatment.
* Interaction between Income and Treatment: Wealthier individuals might benefit less from certain policies than poorer individuals.
* Interaction between Education and Treatment: Individuals with higher education might have different responses to certain interventions.

## Unobserved Confounders (Optional for simulation)
* Latent Variable: A continuous unobserved variable influencing both treatment and outcome.
* Measurement Error: Random noise added to covariates or outcomes to simulate the imperfections in real-world data collection.
